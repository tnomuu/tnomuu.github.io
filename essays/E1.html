<p>Overall, it took me a while to complete all the WODs. The first one took me about an hour. But I was also watching football while doing it, so maybe a little less. I would say that one was more difficult because you’re kind of starting from scratch building a new web page. Once I got to WODs 2 and 3, I would say it was less difficult because you had something to build off from, which was the previous WOD. So just getting started was a little tough for me. In WOD 1, once I got rolling I wouldn’t say it was too difficult, but more straight forward as I got the hang of it. I would say the hardest part was trying to create the table of contents with the hyperlinks, but even that wasn’t too bad. Moving onto WOD 2, this one I had a tough time with the css part at first, but again, wasn’t too bad. Linking it wasn’t hard at all, it was just more knowing what tags to put for the html. Finally, in WOD 3, this one was definitely one of the harder ones. I would say because of the lack of instructions, and it was so brief. I was lost on the css part when having to format everything and making the table of contents into a navigation bar. I had to get some help for this one, and still a little confusing but for the most part I think I got it. Like I said, the first WOD took me about an hour. The second one maybe 10 minutes, and the last one maybe about 20. But WODs 2 and 3 I tried to do maybe once or twice before filming the screencast. I felt in doing them over, I understand a little better on what to do. Throughout this process, and just these past weeks in general, I learned html and css is not easy, coding is not easy. Learning how to code and everything that comes with it, comes with time and a lot of practice.<img src="https://github.com/tnomuu/tnomuu.github.io/assets/143229622/2dc22fef-2ba7-4153-8fcf-37cf24f21a46" alt="image" /></p>
