I decided to take ITM352 because MIS is something that I am interested in pursuing. I'm not fully sold on the major yet, but I was hoping, in taking this course, I would have a better idea of what I want to do. Some of my good friends are also MIS majors, so that sparked some interest as well. I also know that in MIS, there are many job opportunities once you graduate. MIS is also just something different, and thats what I wanted to do. I wanted to challenge myself, and see if I have what it takes. I knew, going into this, it was not going to be easy, but i'm all for giving it a try.
