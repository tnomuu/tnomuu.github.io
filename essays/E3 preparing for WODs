After completing WOD 5.1, I realized it wasn’t the most difficult in the world. I would say out of any assignment we’ve had so far; this has been the easiest. Nothing too crazy, I thought of it mostly just as replacing some functions that essentially do the same thing and reassigning some values. Reading the instructions, I thought it was pretty straightforward. So, as I read through what we had to do, I kind of thought about what it was asking and what I need to do for that to happen. After this, I then went on to watch the screencast one time and tried to do the WOD. Watching the video was a big help in just knowing what to do and going through the different functions. One important thing I found very helpful was the find command, or command f. This was vital in cutting down the amount of time it took to complete the WOD. Just for it go look for what we want to change and replace it was cool. I think the biggest thing that I need to continue to work on is just remembering what functions do what and when to use them. Next time I think I can run through the WOD before filming. This was my first try, and I think I could have been more efficient if I ran through it one time before. But, still happy with the work I did.
